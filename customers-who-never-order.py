Table: Customers

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
 

Table: Orders

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
customerId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 

Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 

Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+

Output: 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

# This function identifies customers who have never placed an order by performing a left join between the customers and orders tables.  
# It filters out customers whose 'id' does not match any 'customerId' in the orders table (i.e., those with NaN values in 'customerId').  
# Finally, it selects only the 'name' column, renaming it to 'Customers', and returns the resulting DataFrame.

    df = df[['name']].rename(columns={'name': 'Customers'})
